# System requirements

## Operation system
First and foremost you will need a Windows machine with at least Windows XP.  I have heard of people testing Terminals with Wine on non-Windows machines but most of what has been done locks us to good old Microsoft.

## Version 2.0

**.NET Framework**:
Because this project is based on .NET framework, you will need to install .NET runtime first. At least .NET framework 3.5 is required. You can download it from Microsoft sites:
[x86 Redist Package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70848)
[x64 Redist Package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70849)
Select other languages then English here:
[.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=22)

**Remote desktop client (RDP client)**
Since Terminals 1.9, RDP connections require RDP Client 6 or higher to work correctly.
No other remote control tool has to be installed. This version doesn't support RDP 8 protocol.

The RDP6 client comes with native installations of Windows Vista and above and can be downloaded for other operating Systems from the following links:
