**November 10, 2011** - Automatic Buids
Friends of ours have graciously allowed us to piggy back on their TeamCity installation, which allows us to start publishing frequent builds. In fact we setup TeamCity to produce a build on every code commit! For more info, check the Continuous integration chapter in developer guide in online documentation.
 
**November 1, 2011** - Beta Release for version 2
Now that we have made some serious progress through the bug tracker the team has decided that now would be a good time to re-enter the beta/testing stage for a final version 2.0 release.  Please take time to download the release and provide feedback ASAP.

**June 26, 2011** - An Update.
I ran through the Issue Tracker and pushed out all issues to either a 2.0 or 2.1 build.  The 2.0 items are items which we are going to try to achieve to get done for an official 2.0 release.  If your item is NOT in that list, raise the issue and lets discuss.  All items pushed to 2.1 are pushed to a "future" release, be that 2.1 or beyond.  
I also tried to close any long standing, inactive issues which seem dormant and I couldn't easily reproduce.  If something was closed in error, just re-open it and we can deal with it accordingly.
